# Tasks

## 1 - Initialize project using Create React App

- Create a new React + Typescript project using `create-react-app`.  
  This will create a new sub folder containing a template project.

  ```bash
  npx create-react-app react-workshop --template=typescript
  ```

- Change into the project directory

  ```bash
  cd react-workshop
  ```

- Start the project (development server with file watching)

  ```bash
  npm run start
  ```

If your browser doesn't open the website automatically, visit the url provided by the `npm run start` command.

### Bonus

- Explore the directory structure of the repository. Can you guess what each file's purpose is?
- Try to change the title of the page (the text shown in the browser tab handle next to the favicon) to 'Bookmonkey'
- Make the React Logo spin faster and counter-clock-wise
