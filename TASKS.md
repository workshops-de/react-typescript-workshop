# Tasks

## 1 - Initialize project using Create React App

- Create a new React + Typescript project using `create-react-app`.  
  This will create a new sub folder containing a template project.

  ```bash
  npx create-react-app react-workshop --template=typescript
  ```

- Change into the project directory

  ```bash
  cd react-workshop
  ```

- Start the project (development server with file watching)

  ```bash
  npm run start
  ```

If your browser doesn't open the website automatically, visit the url provided by the `npm run start` command.

### Bonus

- Explore the directory structure of the repository. Can you guess what each file's purpose is?
- Try to change the title of the page (the text shown in the browser tab handle next to the favicon) to 'Bookmonkey'
- Make the React Logo spin faster and counter-clock-wise

## 2 - Add an AppHeader component

- In the `src/App.tsx` file, create a new function component called `AppHeader`, which renders a simple h1 heading
- Add the `AppHeader` at the top of the `App` component. Remove the existing demo content and the existing class definitions in `App.css`

The rest of the exercise is refactoring to a more scalable directory structure:

- Create a new directory for reusable components: `src/components` and add a directory for the `AppHeader` component, with an `AppHeader.tsx` and `index.ts` file.
  ```
  src/
    components/
      AppHeader/
        - AppHeader.tsx
        - index.ts
  ```
- Move the `AppHeader` function into `AppHeader.tsx` and export it (named export).
- Re-export everything (`*`) from `AppHeader.tsx` in the `index.ts` file and import the `AppHeader` from `./components/AppHeader` in `App.tsx`

### Hints

```tsx
export const AppHeader = () => {
  return <h1>Bookmonkey</h1>;
};
```

```ts
export * from "./AppHeader";
```

```ts
import { AppHeader } from "./components/AppHeader";
```

```tsx
<div className="App">
  <AppHeader />
</div>
```

### Bonus

- Create an `AppHeader.css` file next to the `.tsx` file, import it and use it to adjust some styles. Try to make sure that the css rules only affect the `AppHeader` component.
- Use css to center the contents of the App horizontally in the page with a maximum width of 600px and a padding of 1rem.

## 3 - Display an example book

- Create a new component called `ExampleBook` and add it to the `App`. Follow the same folder and files patterns as used for the `AppHeader`.
- Create a directory for domain specific code `src/domain`
- Write a typescript interface that matches the following example book and place it in `src/domain/book/Book.ts`. Also add an `index.ts` file to `src/domain/book` that re-exports everything from `Book.ts`

  ```ts
  const book: Book = {
    id: "1001606140805",
    title: "Java Web Scraping Handbook",
    subtitle: "Learn advanced Web Scraping techniques",
    isbn: "1001606140805",
    abstract:
      "Web scraping or crawling is the art of fetching data from a third party website by downloading and parsing the HTML code to extract the data you want. It can be hard.

    cover:
      "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/workshops-de/bookmonkey-api/master/public/covers/1001606140805.png",
  };
  ```

- Add this `const book ` binding to the function body of the `ExampleBook` component. Display the title, subtitle and author of the example book.

### Hints

```ts
export interface Book {
  id: string;
  title: string;
  subtitle: string;
  isbn: string;
  abstract: string;
  author: string;
  publisher: string;
  price: string;
  numPages: number;
  cover: string;
}
```

```ts
import { Book } from "../../domain/book";
```

```tsx
return (
  <div>
    <h2>{book.title}</h2>
    <h3>{book.subtitle}</h3>
    <div>by {book.author}</div>
  </div>
);
```

### Bonus

- Display the cover of the book (contained within a 100px x 100px square)
- Display the example book 3 times
- Display the example book 100 times

## 4 - Create a BookListItem component

- Create a new component called `BookListItem`. Follow the same folder/file pattern as before.
- Show the same data as the `ExampleBook`, but this time make the book to be displayed a prop of the component. Don't forget to add an interface for the props, call it `BookListItemProps`.
- Add a new file `domain/book/exampleBooks`, re-export its contents in `index.ts` and add this list of example books

```ts
export const exampleBooks: Book[] = [
  {
    id: "1001606140805",

```

- Using the `BookListItem` component, replace the `ExampleBook` in the `App` component and display the first two books from the exampleBooks array.

### Hints

```tsx
export interface BookListItemProps {
  book: Book;
}

export const BookListItem = ({ book }: BookListItemProps) => {
  /*...*/
};
```

### Bonus

- Add css styles in a `BookListItem.css` file to add a border, subtle shadow and padding to the BookListItem

## 5 - Display a list of books

- Instead of only showing the first two example books, render the entire list using the `map` array method. Don't forget to set the key attribute on each ListItem.
- Move the list rendering logic into a new `BookList` component, which takes the `books` as a prop

### Hints

```tsx
<>
  {books.map((book) => (
    <BookListItem book={book} key={book.id}></BookListItem>
  ))}
</>
```

### Bonus

- Try to omit any wrapping `<div>` or other html elements, so that the BookList component only renders the BookListItems.
- Add a header to the book list that shows the number of books in the list
- Since the `BookListItem` component belongs to the `BookList` move its directory into the `BookList` directory and adjust the imports
- Display the minimum and maximum number of pages in the `BookList` header.
- Display the minimum and maximum price of the books in the `BookList` header

## 6 - Display a money bag emoji next to free books

- Display the money bag emoji `&#x1F4B0;` right after the title of books that cost `$0.00`.
- Add an `underline` text decoration as well to all free books. You can either use `className` or a `style` binding

### Hints

```tsx
{
  isFree && <span> &#x1F4B0;</span>;
}
```

```tsx
<h2 style={{ color: isRed ? "red" : "blue" }}>Title</h2>
```

### Bonus

- Display an emoji of your choice next to books that are particularaly long (> 500 pages)
- Display one to three dollar signs next to books depending on their price, e.g. $0 - $10, $10 - $30, $30 - $999

## 7 - Add a like counter to the BookListItem component

- Add a `<button>` element to the BookListItem component that shows a clapping hands emoji (`&#128079;`)
- Keep track how many times the button was clicked and display that number next to the emoji.
- If the button was clicked 5 or more times show a star emoji (`&#11088;`) in front of the book title.

### Hints

```tsx
const [numLikes, setNumLikes] = useState(0);
```

```tsx
<button onClick={() => setNumLikes(numLikes + 1)}>&#128079;</button>
```

### Bonus

- Extract the like counter into a separate `LikeCounter` component. Pass both the current count as well as a callback function to set the count as props.
- Add another button for dislike. Only show the star when there's a +5 positive balance towards likes
- If the num Likes is 0, don't display that number

## 8 - Display the book's abstract, but make it hideable

- Display the book's abstract in the `BookListItem` component.
- Add a button to toggle if the abstract is being shown or hidden. The button text should be `+` or `-` depending on the state
- Create a new `Hideable` component, which encapsulates this behaviour. The `Hideable` component should render the children elements passed to it and a button to show/hide them.
- Use the `Hideable` component in `BookListItem`.

### Hints

```tsx
<Hideable>{book.abstract}</Hideable>
```

```tsx
import { ReactNode } from "react";

export interface MyComponentProps {
  children: ReactNode;
}
```

```tsx
{
  shouldShowChildren && children;
}
```

Hint for fade in animation bonus task:

```css
.fade-in {
  animation: fade-in 1s;
}

@keyframes fade-in {
  from {
    opacity: 0;
  }
  to {
    opacity: 100;
  }
}
```

### Bonus

- Add a prop to `Hideable` to set the initial state to either hidden or visible.
- Add an optional prop to set a maximum height for the contents of `Hideable` and make sure a scrollbar is shown when this height limit is reached.
- Add an animation that fades in the content when it's being shown.

## 9 - Fetch and display books from the Bookmonkey Api

- Start the bookmonkey-api server in a separate terminal. Visit [http://localhost:4730/books] to verify.
  ```bash
  npx bookmonkey-api
  ```
- Create a new `async` function called `fetchBooks` in `src/domain/book/api.ts` which sends a get request to [http://localhost:4730/books], parses the response body as json and returns an array of books. Don't forget to re-export `./api` from `index.ts`
- In `App.tsx`, instead of displaying the exampleBooks, start out with an empty books array and initiate fetching the books on the first render.

### Hints

```ts
async () => {
  const response = await fetch(url);
  const data = await response.json();
  return data as MyType;
};
```

```ts
const [books, setBooks] = useState<Book[]>([]);
```

Workaround, because react prohibits the useEffect handler to be async

```ts
useEffect(() => {
  const fetchData = async () => {
    // Use await here...
    const data = await fetchSomething();
    // ...
  };
  fetchData(); // initiate async operation, but don't wait
});
```

### Bonus

- Show the text 'Loading...' while waiting for a response from the server. You'll probably have to artifically throttle the network speed in the browser's devtools to notice.
- Show an error message, if the server is not reachable or returns an error status code
- Make the `BOOKMONKEY_API_URL` an environment variable. [Create-React-App Documentation: Adding custom environment variables](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/adding-custom-environment-variables/)
